# Example app to showcase hybrid rendering mode in Nuxt

`pnpm i && pnpm build` then `pnpm preview`

You can chose different rendering modes depending on the routes of your app:

- "/" and "/chat" is prerendered (SSG)
- "/chat/[id]" is SSRed
- "/spa" is client rendered (you should see a loader until the HTML is fully generated by the JS)

The loading HTML file can be found in the app/ folder.
